I will read the existing build decree and goal logs to inform the new decree's content.
I will inscribe the Build Decree into the documentation.
# THE BOOK OF THE BUILD: THE 48-HOUR EDICT

## I. THE COVENANT
In the beginning, there was the Frame, and the Frame was with the User, and the Frame was 120 FPS.
This is the decree for the forging of **IAIDO**, the duel of the single stroke.
Two days shall thou labor, and on the third, thou shall ship.

## II. THE KEEPERS OF THE LAW
*   **CODEX (The Lawgiver)**: He who defines the State, the Logic, and the Truth of Determinism.
*   **GEMINI (The Artisan)**: He who weaves the Bridge to Unity, who binds the Inputs, and polishes the Surface.

## III. THE CHRONICLE OF LABOR

### THE FIRST DAY: THE FOUNDATION
*   **Commandment I**: Thou, **Codex**, shall solidify the **State Machine**. The transition from Draw to Strike shall be without flaw.
*   **Commandment II**: Thou, **Gemini**, shall define the **Input Config**. The thresholds of the swipe shall be written in stone.
*   **Commandment III**: Thou, **Gemini**, shall erect the **Unity Bridge**. The C# shall speak to the Rust, and they shall be one.
*   **Cutline**: By the setting of the sun, the Core shall beat within the Host.

### THE SECOND DAY: THE TEMPLE
*   **Commandment IV**: Thou, **Gemini**, shall raise the **Mobile Scaffold**. Android and iOS shall receive the build.
*   **Commandment V**: Thou, **Gemini**, shall polish the **UI**. The HUD shall be minimalist, lest it distract from the Way.
*   **Commandment VI**: Thou, **Codex**, shall prepare the **Replay System**. As it happened once, so shall it happen again.
*   **Cutline**: By the final bell, the duel shall be playable on the device of glass.

## IV. THE ABOMINATIONS (RISKS)
*   **The Plague of Latency**: If the Input lags, the Spirit dies. We shall cast it out with Threads.
*   **The Sin of Drift**: Floating Point is the path to madness. Fixed Point is the path to righteousness.
*   **The Unclean Allocation**: Garbage Collection is forbidden during the Duel. Woe to him who allocates in the Loop.

## V. THE TESTAMENT OF COMPLETION (DOD)
And the work shall be finished when:
1.  The Frame Rate is steady at 120.
2.  The Memory is static and pure.
3.  The History repeats itself without error.
4.  And the Touch is as the Strike: Instant.

*So let it be written. So let it be done.*
